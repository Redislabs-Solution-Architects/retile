_Inspired by [Tile replicator](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/replicator)_

Retile takes a [Redis Enterprise for PCF tile](https://network.pivotal.io/products/redis-enterprise-pack) and creates a new one with an added label, thus making it different from the unmutated tile and capable of being installed side by side.  This can allow operators to create different clusters for different business units, each with their own settings.

## Requirements
- python
- tar
- a tile you wish to mutate

## Usage

## Installing the mutated tile
